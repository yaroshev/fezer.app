COPY["description"] = """Most planners give you a longer list. Fezer answers a better question: what should I be doing right now?

Plan your day as time blocks, track the day as it actually happens, then put the two side by side. Your plan stops being optimism and starts being evidence.

PLAN THE DAY IN TIME BLOCKS
Build tomorrow from draggable blocks on a clean timeline: deep work, routines, breaks. Blocks repeat Every Day, on Weekdays, Every Week or Every 2 Weeks, so your morning routine builds itself. Deadlines pin directly onto the same timeline, so due items live inside your day instead of in a separate list.

KNOW WHAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW
The Now tab shows one commitment at a time with clear badges: LIVE for what is running, NOW for what should be happening, NEXT for what is coming and DUE for approaching deadlines. No scanning, no deciding twice.

TRACK TIME WITH ONE TAP
Tap Begin. That is the whole workflow. Drop checkpoints as you work, with notes or photos, to capture how the session actually unfolded. Tracked time lands on your schedule as its own column, next to what you planned.

COMPARE PLAN VS. REALITY
Compare mode shows the planned day beside the tracked day. See which blocks are realistic and which are wishful thinking. Analytics break your time down by front and goal across day, week, month and year.

TURN GOALS INTO SCHEDULED TIME
Goals fail in the gap between written down and scheduled. Fezer closes it. Organize goals into fronts (Work, Family, Personal Wellbeing), record why each goal exists and what the end result looks like, then break it into ordered steps. From any step, Commit: "Complete by" pins a deadline on your day, "Work on" blocks real hours for it, optionally repeating. Progress follows completed steps, and tracked sessions attach to goals, so analytics show the hours each goal truly received.

BUILD A VISION BOARD THAT LEADS SOMEWHERE
Each front and goal can carry a freeform pin board. Add Want, Need, Idea, Thought and Reflection pins with images and text. Focus lenses shift the board between Dream, Plan and Remember. Because the board lives beside your goals, aspiration is one tab away from a scheduled block.

PLAN AND REVIEW YOUR WEEK
Repeating blocks form a standing weekly skeleton. Commit goal steps across the week, move through days quickly to fix collisions before they happen, then close the week in Analytics with planned versus actual by front and goal.

PRIVATE BY DESIGN
No account. No sign-up. No server. No analytics SDKs. Your schedule, your tracked hours and your vision boards stay on your device, and that is the only place they exist.

WHAT YOU GET
- Draggable time blocks with repeats
- Deadline pins on the day timeline

Fezer is for people who already know what they want to do and are tired of losing the day anyway.

Plan it. Track it. Compare it. Own your day."""
