          'A to-do list answers "what needs to be done?" A calendar answers "where do I have to be?" Time blocking answers the question between them: "what will I be doing at 10:15?" You divide the day into blocks -  usually thirty minutes to two hours -  and assign each block one job: a piece of focused work, a batch of small tasks, a meal, a commute, a rest.',
          'The defining move is that everything gets a block, not just meetings. Deep work gets a block. Email gets a block instead of leaking into every gap. Lunch gets a block so it stops being the thing that gets skipped. When the day is fully allocated, "what should I do now?" always has an answer, and the answer was chosen calmly the night before rather than under pressure at 10:14.',

That collision -  painful the first few times -  is the entire value. Prioritization stops being an abstract ranking exercise and becomes a concrete question: which of these two things gets Tuesday morning?',
          'Blocking also moves decisions to when you are good at them. Deciding at 9 PM what tomorrow’s deep work will be costs little; deciding at 9 AM, cold, with a full inbox, costs the best hour of the day. And a block is a commitment to one thing at a time -  a structural defence against the constant low-grade switching that fragments unstructured days.',

        paragraphs: [
          'The typical goal lives in a notes app: well-phrased, reviewed in January, rediscovered with a wince in November. Between those two dates it generated no behaviour -  not because it was a bad goal, but because a written goal is an artifact, and artifacts do not compete for time. Your calendar competes for time. Whatever is on it wins by default, every day, against everything that is not.',
          'So the test of a goal system is brutally simple: does the goal ever become an appointment? If no specific step of it ever occupies a specific hour of a specific day, the goal has no interface with your life -  it is decoration with a deadline.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Before decomposing anything, write two sentences: why this goal exists, and what the world looks like when it is done. "Get fit" cannot be scheduled or finished. "Run three sessions a week, sustained for three months" can be both -  you can point at the week it becomes true.',
          'The written end state does quiet work later. Months in, when the goal has become a grind of steps, it is the thing that answers "why am I doing this?" -  and it is the referee that lets you declare a goal genuinely accomplished and closed, rather than letting everything drift on forever at eighty percent.',

        paragraphs: [
          'The unit that bridges goal and calendar is the step, and a step is defined by one property: you could put it in a time block without further thinking. "Improve the website" is not a step -  faced with it at 9 AM, you would have to start planning, and planning at execution time is where momentum dies. "Draft the pricing page copy" is a step.',
          'A practical decomposition rule: keep splitting until each step fits inside one to three of your real working blocks, and always know the next physical action for every active goal. You do not need the full path mapped to the end -  the first three steps, genuinely schedulable, beat a thirty-step plan you had to invent upfront and will rewrite anyway.',

        paragraphs: [
          'A large body of research on what psychologists call implementation intentions points the same direction: people who decide in advance when and where they will act -  "if it is Tuesday at 7 AM, then I train" -  follow through at meaningfully higher rates than people with identical goals and no trigger. The decision is pre-made, so the moment needs no motivation, only compliance with an appointment.',
          'A schedule is exactly this device. Committing a step means one of two things: it gets a deadline pinned to a real day, or it gets a block of time -  once, or repeating for as long as the goal needs. The repeating form is the strongest move available: a goal with a standing block no longer depends on being remembered, chosen or felt like. It happens the way lunch happens.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Every goal competes with every other goal -  and with your job, family and sleep -  for the same twenty-four hours. Most goal systems hide this competition; a schedule surfaces it. There is one honest metric for how much you are pursuing a goal, and it is not enthusiasm: it is hours received in the last week.',
          'Run the audit weekly, per area of life. Goals sorted by actual hours received produce uncomfortable, useful facts: the goal you talk about most got ninety minutes this month; an area of your life got zero. Then either recommit -  give the starved goal a standing block that survives contact with your real week -  or retire it honestly. A consciously parked goal costs nothing; a phantom goal that is "active" but never receives an hour quietly corrodes the whole system.',

        paragraphs: [
          'Steps and blocks are deliberately mundane -  that is what makes them executable. The risk of a fully proceduralized goal is forgetting what it was for, at which point the standing block becomes one more chore to skip. The antidote is keeping the reason physically near the plan: the image of the finish line, the sentence about why, the photo from the week it started working.',
          'This is the legitimate core of the much-mocked vision board. As decoration, divorced from any plan, a board is a poster. Attached to the goal it motivates -  reviewed in the same session where you look at the hours -  it is the emotional battery of the system, and reflections added along the way turn it into a record that the grind is moving something.',

        'This guide is close to a description of Fezer’s goal layer. Fronts hold the areas of your life; each goal records why it began and what the end looks like, with ordered steps between. Commit turns a step into schedule -  "Complete by" pins a deadline, "Work on" claims a block, once or repeating. Tracked time attaches to goals, so weekly Analytics is precisely the hours-received audit, and every front and goal carries its own vision board with reflection pins.',
